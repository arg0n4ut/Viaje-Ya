## Microservice design and REST API
In this milestone, a minimal microservice was created with a clean structure:
- API layer: FastAPI app  [src/app/main.py](../src/app/main.py).
- Domain models: Pydantic models in [src/app/models.py](../src/app/models.py).
- Repository layer: in-memory repositories in [src/app/repository.py](../src/app/repository.py) backed by [src/app/database.py](../src/app/database.py).

Implemented API features:
- Trips: POST /trips/, GET /trips/, GET /trips/{id}.
- Participants: POST /participants/, GET /participants/, GET /participants/{id}.

FastAPI was chosen as a popular framework with type-hinted request/response models, performance, and good testing ergonomics.

## Logging system
- Added structured request/response logging middleware in [src/app/main.py](../src/app/main.py) using `python-json-logger`.
- Each request logs start/end with fields: request_id, method, path, status_code, duration_ms.
- Response includes an `X-Request-ID` header for traceability.

The structured logs offer the advantage of being machine-friendly and suitable for aggregation (CI/CD, cloud logs).


## Tests
- API tests: see [src/tests/test_api.py](../src/tests/test_api.py) and [src/tests/test_main.py](../src/tests/test_main.py).
- Logging tests: see [src/tests/test_logging.py](../src/tests/test_logging.py) validating header presence and log records.
- Test fixtures: [src/tests/conftest.py](../src/tests/conftest.py) sets up clean in-memory state.


## Packaging and build
- Added [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml) (PEP 517) using setuptools with `src/` layout to build sdist/wheel.
- Makefile targets in [Makefile](../Makefile):
  - install, install-dev
  - build (python -m build)
  - install-wheel (installs wheel from dist/)
  - clean (cross-platform)
- Helper script [scripts/install_wheel.py](../scripts/install_wheel.py) installs the latest built wheel.

Building and installing the wheel validates the real distributable artifact (reproducible and deployable). It ensures package metadata and runtime dependenciess are correct, that package data and entry points are included in the final artifact, and it can show install-time issues that do not appear when running tests from source. Wheels are also faster and more deterministic to install and can be reused in Docker images or other deployment pipelines.

The Makefile targets and helper script standardize the local and CI workflow.

## Continuous Integration
- Updated workflow [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) to execute Makefile targets:
  - `make install → make build → make install-wheel → make test`
  - clean artifacts: `make clean`
