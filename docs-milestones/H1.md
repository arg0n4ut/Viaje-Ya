## Suitability for Cloud Computing
This project is suitable for cloud computing because it involves multiple services that can be deployed independently, scaled if needed, and accessed by different users.
Using Python microservices with FastAPI/Flask, MongoDB for storage, and Docker containers allows each component (trips, voting, maps, files, etc.) to run in isolated, reproducible environments. GitHub Actions enables automated testing and continuous integration.
Deployment on a PaaS like Render or Fly.io provides cloud hosting, scalability, and easy management without handling servers manually.\
 This aligns well with cloud-native application principles and makes this a suitable project for the course.
