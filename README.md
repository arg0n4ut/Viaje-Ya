# Viaje-Ya
Simple web app for organizing group trips.

Development in the practical part of the course "Cloud Computing: Fundamentos e Infraestructuras" at the Universidad de Granada, taught by Claudia Villalonga.

## Development status
- project repository set up
- Python virtual environment set up
- testing approach (TDD with pytest) defined and basic test created
- Makefile created to run tests locally and remotely
- continuous integration with GitHub Actions implemented

## Motivation
When organizing a group trip, it can be difficult to keep track of places to visit, activities to do, things to pack, etc.

This way, everyone can easily contribute to the planning and have all the important information accessible in one place.

## Features to be implemented
- manage trips and participants
- proposal and voting system for destinations and activities
- map integration for destinations and activities
- packing and todo lists
- bundle important informationa and documents
- expense tracking / splitting
